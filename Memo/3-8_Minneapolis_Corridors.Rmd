#1. Introduction

In order to make their cities more livable, policymakers and planning departments are improving streets and upgrading transportation infrastructure  in order to improve access and mobility for pedestrians and bicyclists through the reduction of on-street parking or traffic lanes. While studies have shows how such upgrades improve safety the question remains whether such infrastructure improvements also improve the economic outcomes of improved corridors. This study will attempt to answer to what extent these types of corridor-level street improvements impact economic activity and business vitality.

#2. Data Sources/Methodology

##2.1.  Data Sources

For this study we used multiple data sources to estimate the effect of new bike lane infrastructure investment. First, we used the Longitudical Origin-Destination Employment Statistics (LODES) dataset from the Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics Dataset (LEHD).  It integrates existing data from state-supplied administrative records on workers and employers with existing census, surveys, and other administrative records to create a longitudinal data system on U.S employment. This dataset tracks Workplace Area Characteristics (WAC), census blocks where people work as opposed to where workers live, for all the census blocks between 2002 and 2015 for most of the states in the US.  As such, LEHD provides geographically granular detail about Americanâ€™s jobs, workers and local economies, allowing us to examine employment by broad industry sector, wage and educational attainment. Some disadvantages of the LODES dataset are that in order to guarantee confidentiality block level data is "fuzzed" so the numbers are not exactly the number of jobs, but they are accurate estimates. Additionally, though we get industrial data, it is only provided at the most general level (the equivalent of two digit NAICS codes) so we are unable to isolate specific retail or service employment such as restaurant workers. That being said, the LODES dataset is comprehensive, offers unprecedented geographic detail, and longitudinal allowing for consistent comparisons over time.

This report also takes advantage of establishment level Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) data. Also referred to as ES-202 data, the QCEW is quarterly data submitted by firms to their respective state governments as part of the unemployment insurance system. Employers report their industry code, their number of employees at the site, and gross pay. The individual QCEW data is confidential and requires special permission from the state in order to use it and has additional data use restrictions. The QCEW gives us address level data on individual establishments as well as detailed employment information. Unfortunately, getting access to such data is difficult and differs for each state and has to be presented in a way to preserve confidentiality. As such, we cannot present ultra-detailed industrial information and have further presentation restrictions depending on the state.

Finally, we also collected sales tax data. Sales tax data allows us to estimate a more sensitive measure of economic activity than employment (as the decision to hire or fire for a firm is often an expensive one we expect employment to be a delayed response). Some drawbacks of sales tax data is that some states do not have a sales tax or, in states or cities that do have one, the sales tax data is not broken down by specific industry and it is difficult to accurately parse out accurate figures. But the benefits of sales tax data largely outweigh these issues and do offer a more sensitive metric than employment. 

##2.2  Methdology

We have applied three methods in order to isolate the impact of street improvements while controlling for other economic and regional factors. The methods are an integrated trend analysis (following the NY DOT study), a difference-in-difference approach, and an interrupted time series analysis. 

###2.2.1  Corridor Comparison Selection

In order to properly isolate the effect of the street improvements we must identify treatment corridors (corridors that actually were improved) and control corridors (corridors that are similar to the treatment corridors except they remain unimproved). Treatment corridors are corridors where new bike or pedestrian related improvements were installed. Ideally, these corridors are made up of a minimum of 10 adjacent, or intersecting, census blocks with a minimal number of retail and accommodations related jobs. Additionally, we will only use corridors where street improvements were installed between 2008 and 2013 in order to guarantee with have sufficient data to track pre and post-treatment employment trends. 

Once corridors are selected based on these criteria we require further testing in order to discern how similar the proposed treatment and control corridors. Finding corridors that are as similar as possible to each other except for the construction of new bicycle/pedestrian infrastructure allows us to approximate true experimental conditions. We will use a combination of descriptive statistics- comparing corridor employment figures to city employment quantiles- and statistical tests- t-tests in order to determine if the average employment, by block, for each corridor is similar to the other.

###2.2.2  Aggregated Trend Comparison

This first method follows the previous NYCDOT study (NYCDOT, 2013), aiming to examine whether the treatment corridors tend to have better business performance than comparison corridors after street improvements. The approach compares the trends of treatment and control corridors in addition to city-wide trends over the full time period we have data for. If treatment corridors show greater increases in employment or sales tax receipts that would represent a positive impact of street improvement on business activities. This method is easy to follow and represents the aggregated trend of business activities. However, it lacks the rigor of econometric estimates and statistical tests that explicitly test whether or not the street improvement caused the change in trend.

###2.2.3  Difference-in-Difference

The second method aims to estimate the difference in business vitality of pre- and post-improvement periods between improved and comparison corridors within the same time period. This is known as a difference-in-difference (DID) approach. It is a designed to answer the "but for" question of what a corridor's economic trajectory would look like had it streets not been improved.  It requires data from pre/post intervention such as panel data (individual level data overtime) or cross-sectional data (individual or group level). The approach looks at the change in the variable of interest in the treatment group before and after it is treated. In this case this means looking at some time period before and after a street improvement. Meanwhile, the control group has not been treated in either time period. The difference in growth trajectories between the two periods will give an unbiased estimate of the effect of the treatment. DID is a useful technique when randomization on the individual level is not possible. This approach removes biases in the second period comparisons between the treatment group and control group that could be result from permanent differences between those groups, as well as biases from comparisons over time in the treatment group that could be the result of trends. A key assumption of DID estimate is that the differences between control group and treatment group would have remained constant in the absence of treatment. 

DID is a linear modeling approach and its basic formula is expressed as:

$$ Y_{it} = \beta_0 + \beta_1T_{it} + \beta_2A_{it} + \beta_3T_{it}A_{it} +\varepsilon_{it} $$

$Y_{it}$ is the observed outcome in groups i and t (in this case change in employment or sales tax revenue)
$T_{it}$ is a dummy variable set to 1 if the observation is from the treatment group
$A_{it}$ is a dummy variable set to 1 if the observation is from the post treatment period i either groups
$\beta_3$ is the DID estimate of the treatment effect

If the DID estimate $\beta_3$  is significant and positive, then that indicates a positive effect of the street improvement. Conversely if the estimate is significant and negative that indicates a negative effect of the improvement. Finally, a non-significant result indicates the improvement had no statistically discernible effect. 

###2.2.4  Interrupted Time Series

Interrupted time series is an econometric technique that estimates how street improvements impact corridor economic vitality from a longitudinal perspective. This approach tracks the treatment corridor over time and estimates the impact by the treatment by looking at the change of the corridor growth trend after the treatment. If the treatment has a causal impact, the post-intervention series will have a different level or slope than the pre-intervention series. In our research, interrupted-time series will be used to distinguish differences in growth before and after a specific time break point where an intervention, such as installation of new bicycled facility happens.  

One advantage of ITS is that it allows for the statistical investigation of potential biases in the estimate of the effect of the intervention. Given the longitudinal nature of the test ITS requires a significantly larger amount of data in order to accurately estimate a real effect on the growth trend. 

The interrupted time-series analysis equation can be expressed as: 

$$ Y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1T_1 + \beta_2X_1 + \beta_3T_1X_1 +\varepsilon_{it} $$

$Y_t$ is the observed business outcome in time period t
$T_t$ indicates the number of quarters from start to finish of the series
$X_t$ is the treatment dummy variable taking values of 0 in the pre-intervention period and 1 in the post-intervention period
$\beta_0$ is the model intercept or baseline level at T = 0
$\beta_1$ represents the change in the outcome with a time unit increase (the pre-intervention trend)
$\beta_2$ is the level change following the intervention
$\beta_3$ indicates the slope change following the intervention

                       probs = p)

```



#3. Corridor Comparisons

Our first test in corridor comparability is comparing the count of the total number, retail, and accommodation jobs within the corridors compared to block figures for the city of Minneapolis as a whole. This is allows us to have a broad understanding of the relative job density of the corridors. This serves two purposes: first, it gives us a quick estimate of the range of jobs the corridors have; and second, it shows how similar the corridors are to each other in terms of the number of jobs in each. Finally, we perform a t-test, a statistical test designed to measure if the means of two different groups are statistically similar. This final test offers us a more rigorous test of the comparability of the corridors. All of these figures use 2007 employment numbers from the LEHD as that is the earliest year before the first improvement project. 

##3.1 Riverside Ave.

![Riverside Avenue Corridor](images/minneapolis_riverside_corridor_blkgrp.png)



Our first corridor group consists of the Riverside and Cedar Ave corridors. The Cedar Ave comparison corridor is only 2,000 feet and covers three census blocks and is too small for meaningful comparison but we shall continue forward with the analysis.

                                  service2 = CNS07 + CNS12 + CNS14 + CNS17 + CNS18 + CNS19,
                                  busi_perc1 = business/service1,

###3.1.1 Corrdior Employment Counts

The following table shows total, retail, and accommodations employment for Riverside and Cedar and the city based percentile rank of the corridors. Both corridors are in the top 5% of the city in terms of the number of total and retail. Neither corridor has any accommodations employment.  


| Corridor       | Tot Emp | Retail Emp | Accom Emp | Tot (%) | Retail (%) | Accom (%) |
|----------------|---------|------------|-----------|---------|------------|-----------|
| Riverside Ave. | 5341    | 199        | 102         | 95      | 95         | 95       |
| Cedar Ave.     | 672     | 97          | 0         | 95      | 95         | N/A       |

Table 1: Riverside and Cedar Avenue Employment Percentiles

###3.1.2 Corridor Average Employment Comparisons

We performed t-tests on three metrics at the census block level: "business" employment, the sum of retail and accommodations employment; a "business share" metric that is the share of employment in a census block of business employment over the sum of other services industries such as professional/scientific services, public administration and educational services; finally, a second business share metric on a smaller share of services employment including professional/scientific services, administrative/waste management services and arts/accommodation services (check appendix for variable definitions).

On all three metrics the t-test returned non-significant results meaning that there is not a statistically significant difference in the mean employment levels between the two corridors. This means that the corridors are comparable and are appropriate for continued testing. 

###3.1.3 Employment Trend Comparisons

Riverside retail employment trends seem to suggest a possible positive effect of the bike infrastructure installation with a major jump in employment in the two years immediately after construction and positively trending employment growth since the initial jumps. The comparison corridor's (Cedar Avenue) employment remains basically unchanged except for a minor bump between 2010 and 2011 where employment returns to 2009 levels. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width = 9, fig.asp=.5}

riverside_agg <- agg_index_trend_table(minn_corridor, group = 1, construct_year = 2009)

riverside_agg_retail_plot <- agg_index_trend_plot(riverside_agg, industry = "Retail", corridor_name = "Riverside Ave.",industry_code = "CNS07_sd", construct_year = 2009, end_year = 2010)

riverside_agg_accom_plot <- agg_index_trend_plot(riverside_agg, industry = "Accommodations", corridor_name = "Riverside Ave.",industry_code = "CNS18_sd", construct_year = 2009, end_year = 2010)

plot_grid(riverside_agg_retail_plot, riverside_agg_accom_plot, align = "h")

```


The Riverside accommodations patterns are more mixed. Employment growth for the improvement corridor is more robust and consistent after construction compared to the control corridor. The trend analysis here implies a potential positive effect of the infrastructure construction but given the control corridor's positive trends it is not clear that the infrastructure development itself has an independent effect.

###3.1.4 Difference-in-Difference

The Riverside/Cedar Avenue treatment corridor exhibits a statistically significant and positive effect of infrastructure construction on the number of retail jobs and a positive, but non-significant, effect on accommodations employment. According to our model, Riverside Avenue grew by more than 285 jobs compared to the control corridor. 

[insert riverside d-i-d table]

###3.1.5 ITS

The Riverside Ave corridor does not exhibit a level or slope change from the pre-treatment trend patterns in our current specification of the model. While the ts_year coefficient for retail is positive and significant this only tells us that the growth trend of retail employment for the corridor is itself positive. The non-significant **prepost** and **ts_year:pre_post** indicate that there was neither a level or slope change attributable to the treatment.

##3.2 Franklin Ave

![Frankline Avenue Corridor](images/minneapolis_franklin_corridor_blkgrp.png)

###3.2.1 Corridor Employment Counts

The Franklin Avenue corridors are both within the top 10% of areas in the city with respect total and retail employment, though the Franklin treatment corridor is in the 90th percentile of total employment compared to the 95th percentile of the Franklin control corridor. The Franklin Avenue control corridor is also in the top 5% of areas of the city in accommodations employment while the improvement corridor has no accommodations employment.

Table 2: Franklin Ave. Corridors Employment Percentiles

###3.2.2 Corridor Average Employment Comparisons


In terms of the t-tests both corridors have statistically non-significant differences in "business" employment and their business employment share categories. Thus these corridors are appropriate comparators for further study.

###3.2.3 Employment Trend Comparisons
Retail employment does show consistent, though moderate, growth for the improvement corridor though the control corridor has a dramatic spike in employment between 2014 and 2015. In terms of overall trends, the control corridor has consistently higher year over year growth compared to the treatment corridor. 


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.asp=.75}

franklin_agg <- agg_index_trend_table(minn_corridor, group = 2, construct_year  = 2011)

franklin_agg_retail_plot <- agg_index_trend_plot(franklin_agg, industry = "Retail", industry_code = "CNS07_sd", construct_year = 2011, end_year = 2012, corridor_name = "Franklin Ave. Corridor")


franklin_agg_accom_plot <- agg_index_trend_plot(franklin_agg, industry = "Accommodations", industry_code = "CNS18_sd", construct_year = 2011, end_year = 2012, corridor_name = "Frankline Ave. Corridor")

plot_grid(franklin_agg_retail_plot, franklin_agg_accom_plot)

```


In terms of accommodations employment the trend analysis is relatively ambiguous. In the post-construction period both the improvement and control corridor employment remained flat to slightly negative while the improvement corridor sees dramatic growth in the last year to year period. Given the timing and dramatic change in growth it is unlikely the construction itself is responsible for the spike. 

###3.2.4 Difference-in-Difference

The Franklin Avenue corridor difference term is also significant with an estimate that the infrastructure treatment is responsible . According to our estimates, the infrastructure placement on Franklin Avenue is responsible for an additional 120 retail jobs with no statistically significant effect for accommodations jobs.

[insert d-i-d table]

###3.2.5 ITS

Franklin Avenue exhibits mixed results. For accommodations employment the corridor lost a significant number of jobs, thus the large, negative and statistically significant change in level seen in the **prepost** term, but also there is a positive shift in the *slope*. This is seen visually in the aggregate employment chart for accommodations employment for the corridor where there is a clear drop in employment after construction and then a massive jump in employment between 2014 and 2015. Due to a lack of data it is unclear whether this rise will taper off creating a new, higher level of employment, but it does seem like the corridor potentially has a positive shift in accommodations employment.

##3.3 Central Avenue

![Central Avenue Corridor](images/minneapolis_central_ave_corridor_blkgrp.png)

###3.3.1 Corridor Employment Counts


Both the Central and University Avenue corridors have total and retail employment in the top 5% of blocks in the city. Central Avenue also has accommodations employment equal to the top 5% of blocks in the city.

Table 3: Central and University Avenue Corridors Employment Percentiles

###3.3.2 Corridor Average Employment Comparisons

All t-tests came back non-significant at the .05 level meaning that the two corridors are appropriate comparators.

###3.3.3 Employment Trend Comparisons

Central Avenue shows a clear positive retail employment trend post-construction for the treatment corridor that eventually overtakes the control corridor in the latest period. Note that both corridors have positive employment trends post-construction though the control corridor has its most dramatic year to year growth during the construction period.

The accommodations employment trend is more ambiguous. The treatment corridor saw a huge jump in employment immediately post construction but given the largely pre-construction negative trend, the shorter post-construction period, and the extreme growth this is probably due to the entry of some large employer as opposed to a response to new infrastructure.

###3.3.4 Difference-in-Difference

Central Avenue's difference term is significant and highly negative. For Central Avenue, therefore, the installation of the new infrastructure is responsible for the loss of approximately 203 accommodations jobs compared to the control corridor. This result can be intuited if you revisit the aggregate employment graph for the Central Avenue corridors and you can see there is a large gap in the overall number of accommodations jobs between the treatment and control corridor. Additionally, the control corridor has more robust growth over time compared to the treatment.

###3.3.5 ITS

Central Avenue also has mixed results, but due to limited number of data points after construction these results may not be very informative. According to this model specification, Central Avenue retail employment saw a negative, statistically significant drop in employment level after treatment, but there is a positive slope. Again, viewing the aggregate the employment graphs can help the reader to understand these coefficients, particularly the change in slope. It is clear that retail employment seems to be on a positive trajectory, but the lack of additional points make it difficult to come to a solid conclusion on the overall trend. Also note the significant change in slop for the accomodations employment term.

##3.4 Lyndale Avenue South

###3.4.1 Corridor Employment Counts

Lyndale and Grand Avenue diverge in terms of their total employment numbers but are both in the 95th percentile of retail employment when compared to the rest of the city.

###3.4.2 Corridor Average Employment Comparisons

All t-tests came back non-significant meaning that the corridors are acceptable comparators. 

###3.4.3 Employment Trend Comparisons

Retail employment on the Lyndale Avenue corridor looks to only have just recovered its employment since the recession though its growth pattern has been much more consistent than its comparison corridor. Interestingly, both the improved and control corridors saw a spike in retail employment in 2015. This is generally good news for the corridors though we the trend analysis does not show any real impact of the street improvement itself on retail employment. 

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.asp=.75}

lyndale_trend <- agg_index_trend_table(minn_corridor, group = 4, construct_year = 2008)

lyndale_retail_trend <- agg_index_trend_plot(lyndale_trend, industry = "Retail", industry_code = "CNS07_sd", construct_year = 2008, end_year = 2009, corridor_name = "Lyndale Ave. S")

lyndale_accom_trend <- agg_index_trend_plot(lyndale_trend, industry = "Accommodations", industry_code = "CNS18_sd", construct_year = 2008, end_year = 2009, corridor_name = "Lyndale Ave. S")

plot_grid(lyndale_retail_trend, lyndale_accom_trend)

```

In terms of accommodations employment, the treatment corridor shows no real effect due to construction showing only modest overall employment growth since 2008. 

###3.4.4 Difference-in-Difference

For Lyndale Avenue we find a statistically significant and negative effect of infrastructure installation for accommodations employment. Again, the interpretation of the difference term is that "but for" the installation of the infrastructure Lyndale Avenue would have nearly 109 additional accommodations jobs. 

[insert d-i-d]

###3.4.5 ITS


Lyndale exhibits a similar pattern to Central but with the construction completed in 2009 we have enough data post-treatment to have more valid results. In this case, there is a negative, statistically significant drop in the level of accommodations employment for the corridor but a postivive, significant slope. Again, when examining the aggregate employment trend graphs we see a clear drop in employment in 2009 and 2010 and a seeming return to the pre-treatment level with a positive slope. The positive growth trend continues through 2015 but it is unclear if we will see a leveling off of new employment at a higher level or if employment will collapse again.



##3.5 North 2nd Street

###3.5.1 Corridor Employment Counts

North 2nd Street and Broadway Avenue both have total and retail employment in the 95th percentile while Broadway also is in the 95th percentile for the city in accommodations employment, though that translates to only 2 accommodations jobs for the corridor.

Table 5: North 2nd Street and Broadway Corridors Employment Profile

###3.5.2 Corridor Average Employment Comparisons


All t-tests came back non-significant meaning that the corridors are acceptable comparators. 

###3.5.3 Employment Trend Comparisons


North 2nd Street's employment trends point towards a probable impact of street improvement as the overall trend was negative before construction, with a minor rebound immediately pre-construction, a dip during construction, and then rebound in all periods post-construction.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.asp=.75}

north_agg <- agg_index_trend_table(minn_corridor, group = 5, construct_year = 2011)

north_retail_trend <- agg_index_trend_plot(north_agg, industry = "Retail", corridor_name = "North 2nd St.", industry_code = "CNS07_sd", construct_year = 2011, end_year = 2012)

north_accom_trend <- agg_index_trend_plot(north_agg, industry = "Accommodation", corridor_name = "North 2nd St.", industry_code = "CNS18_sd", construct_year = 2011, end_year = 2012)

plot_grid(north_retail_trend, north_accom_trend)

```

Accommodations employment growth is quite robust for the treatment corridor but its growth trend starts at the beginning of the construction period and continues afterwards. 

###3.5.4 Difference-in-Difference

Our difference-in-difference estimation shows a positive and significant effect of treatment responsible for approximately 247 accommodations jobs while retail has a negative but non-significant effect.

##3.6 Conclusions

The aggregated trend analyses presented here show  some potentially interesting effects of street improvement for a select set of corridors, but there do not seem to be any clear patterns running in any given direction. At best, we may be able to conclude that the descriptive data offered here does not show any *negative* effect of street improvement on retail or accommodations employment, and, in some cases, may have a positive effect on employment growth. The trend analysis does offer some tantalizing potential of positive employment effects that the difference-in-difference or time series regression can more accurately tease out. 

#Difference-in-Difference

As mentioned in the introduction, difference-in-difference (DiD) is a linear modeling approach designed to answer the "but for" question of what a corridor's economic trajectory would look like had it streets not been improved. The approach looks at the change in the variable of interest in the treatment group before and after it is treated compared to the change in the variable of interest in the control group. This section presents the DiD results for each of the corridors. While they may appear overwhelming, the Typeimprovement:prepost coefficient is the value that matters for our DiD model. If that therm is significant, then we have evidence that the infrastructure treatment did have a casusal effect on our variables of interest. 





##Conclusion

Overall, there are mixed effects of infrastructure improvement on retail and accommodations jobs. Three corridors- North Second, Franklin, and Riverside- show positive effects of new infrastructure placement but only for retail or accommadations employment. The negative results are also significant for only one of the industries. The mixed nature of the results in terms of significance and affected industries offer some preliminary evidence that the infrastructure does indeed have an effect, but it is unclear exactly what that effect is. 

More importantly, while these results are interesting they should be taken with a heavy grain of salt. Difference-in-difference requires a certain set of assumptions in order for its results to be valid, and, unfortunately, many of the corridors tested do not fit. Two of the main assumptions, the parallel trend assumption, and the independence assumption, are violated in most of these models. The parallel trends assumption dictates that in order for a DiD estimate to be valid the trend in your variable of interest must be similar between your two groups before treatment. In plain terms, the growth trajectory of the two groups should be similar before a policy is enacted. This is not the case for a few of the corridors where it is clear that either the treatment or the control corridor had a dramatically different growth trajectory before treatment even began. The independence assumption basically states that the two groups should not be able to affect each other. A clear violation of this assumption is seen for the Frnaklin Avenue corridor where the control and treatment corridors are the same stretch road. It is unlikely that a change from one corridor will not affect the other as they are touching. As such, while interesting, these DiD estimates are not appropriate. 



#Interrupted Time Series

As described earlier, interrupted time series (ITS) is an econometric technique that estimates the impact of an intervention over time. This approach allows us to track the treatment corridor over time and estimate the impact of the treatment by looking at the change of the corridor growth trend after the treatment. If the treatment has a causal impact, the post-intervention series will have a different level or slope than the pre-intervention series. In our research, interrupted-time series will be used to distinguish differences in growth before and after a specific time break point where an intervention, such as installation of new bicycled facility happens.

While ITS is a useful technique it does require much more available data than a difference-in-difference approach or even an aggregated trend analysis. In particular, ITS requires enough pre-treatment data in order to accurately represent any underlying trends in the data. While post-treatment does not necessarily require as many data points as pre-treatment, analysts still need enough post-treatment data to reasonably estimate the impact of the treatment. This limit imposes two costs on researchers. First, as mentioned, you need more data, overall, to run a proper ITS compared to other techniques. Second, you need a sufficient amount of data *post-treatment* to truly ascertain the impact. This means that depending on the data available infrastructure improvements has to have been concluded probably no later than 2012. But even recognizing these limits, ITS offers a powerful alternative technique for estimating the causal impact of improved infrastructure.
